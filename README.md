# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures

It'a repository for all the projects faced in the Algorithms and Data Structures MicroMaster in edx.org teached by UC San Diego. <https://www.edx.org/es/micromasters/ucsandiegox-algorithms-and-data-structures>

Each folder is a different course.

What will be learned:
* Understand essential algorithmic techniques and apply them to solve algorithmic problems
* Implement programs that work in less than one second even on massive datasets
* Test and debug your code even without knowing the input on which it fails
* Formulate real life computational problems as rigorous algorithmic problems
* Prove correctness of an algorithm and analyze its running time
